<h1> My ANIME Recomendation - By MADHU P  </h1>
<h2> MY top 3 ANIMES recomendation of all time ....</h2>
 <hr> 
<h3> One Piece </h3>
<p> The greatest story telling of all time and one of the longest and still running MANGA and ANIME by ECHIRU ODA</p>
<h3> Jujutsu kaisen </h3>
<p> well written OVER POWER charaters and its a on-going MANGA and ANIME</p>
<h3> Demon Slayer </h3>
<p> The Story doesnt have much to offer but the adaptation into anime gives an edge over other animes through its peak level animation , that keeps the audians intact. </p>
